# **Server Rules**  

    Welcome to our community! To ensure a safe, inclusive, and enjoyable environment for everyone, please follow the rules below. Violations will be handled as outlined in our punishment guidelines.  

  

    ## **1. Be Respectful in Chat**  

    Respect is a fundamental rule of our community. Here's what it means:  

    - **Respect Everyone’s Boundaries**: If someone says they’re uncomfortable, stop immediately.  

    - *Example*: If a member says they don’t want to discuss politics, change the subject without argument.  

    - **Avoid Triggering or Shocking Topics**: Don’t bring up upsetting subjects like violence, self-harm, or other sensitive issues.  

    - *Example*: Talking about graphic real-life events or making jokes about traumatic experiences is not allowed.  

    - **Zero Tolerance for Bigotry**: Homophobia, transphobia, sexism, and any form of hate speech are strictly prohibited.  

    - *Example*: Using slurs or derogatory terms, even as “jokes,” will result in disciplinary action.  

    - **Mutual Respect**: Treat others as you wish to be treated.  

    - *Example*: Don’t dismiss someone’s opinion rudely just because you disagree.

    ## **2. No Advertising**  

    This server is not a platform for promotion. Advertising of any kind is prohibited, including:  

    - **Other Discord Servers**  

    - *Example*: Posting invites to your new gaming Discord without permission.  

    - **Social Media Accounts**  

    - *Example*: Dropping your Twitch stream link without context.  

    - **Services or Commissions**  

    - *Example*: Offering to sell art or promoting your online shop.  

    Advertising disrupts the community vibe and clutters conversations. Keep the focus on meaningful engagement.

    ## **3. Respect Boundaries and Read Profiles**  

    Roles and profiles exist to set clear personal boundaries. Respect them at all times:  

    - **Role Indicators are Important**: If someone has a role like “No Roleplay,” honor their preference.  

    - *Example*: Don’t initiate a roleplay storyline with someone who has opted out, even as a “joke.”  

    - **Consent is Key**: Ensure your actions are welcomed.  

    - *Example*: Sending random friend requests or repeatedly tagging someone who hasn’t consented to it is disrespectful.  

    - **Understand and Honor Preferences**: Take time to read roles and profiles to avoid misunderstandings.  

    - *Example*: If someone has a “DMs Closed” role, don’t message them without permission.

    ## **4. No Mini-Modding**  

    Moderation is for staff only. Here’s what we mean:  

    - **No Nagging Staff**: Report issues once and trust the team to handle it.  

    - *Example*: Constantly DMing staff to ask, “Did you handle my report yet?” is unnecessary.  

    - **Use Proper Channels**: Submit tickets or reports using the designated systems.  

    - *Example*: Instead of calling out someone in chat, use the **#complaints** channel.  

    We appreciate help, but leave the rule enforcement to moderators.

    ## **5. No Sexual Topics**  

    While humor is welcome, explicit or inappropriate content is not.  

    - **Server Age Rating**: Remember, this server is **+15**, not **+18**.  

    - *Example*: Sharing explicit stories or discussing graphic sexual details is prohibited.  

    - **Protecting Minors**: Avoid sexual topics around younger members.  

    - *Example*: Making suggestive jokes when a minor is in the chat is not acceptable.  

    Let’s maintain a space that’s comfortable for everyone.

    ## **6. Be Mindful in Voice Chats (VCs)**  

    Voice chats are shared spaces. Follow these guidelines:  

    - **Microphone Etiquette**: Keep your mic volume reasonable and avoid background noise.  

    - *Example*: Don’t scream into the mic or play loud music during conversations.  

    - **Be Considerate of Others**: Respect the flow of conversation and avoid dominating discussions.  

    - *Example*: Constantly interrupting others or talking over them can make the VC unpleasant.  

    - **Avoid Triggering Topics**: Refrain from discussing harmful or sensitive topics in public VCs.  

    - *Example*: Don’t mention graphic or shocking subjects like violence or self-harm in a public channel.  

    - **Examples of Misconduct**:  

    - Screaming nonstop for no reason  

    - Annoying members by intentionally disrupting the VC  

    - Being rude or mean to others  

    VCs should be welcoming and fun for all participants.
