# **Server Rules**  

Welcome to our community! To ensure a safe, inclusive, and enjoyable environment for everyone, please follow the rules below. Violations will be handled as outlined in our punishment guidelines.  

  

## **1. Be Respectful in Chat**  

Respect is a fundamental rule of our community. Here's what it means:  
- **Respect Everyone’s Boundaries**: If someone says they’re uncomfortable, stop immediately.  

- *Example*: If a member says they don’t want to discuss politics, change the subject without argument.  

- **Avoid Triggering or Shocking Topics**: Don’t bring up upsetting subjects like violence, self-harm, or other sensitive issues.  

- *Example*: Talking about graphic real-life events or making jokes about traumatic experiences is not allowed.  

- **Zero Tolerance for Bigotry**: Homophobia, transphobia, sexism, and any form of hate speech are strictly prohibited.  

- *Example*: Using slurs or derogatory terms, even as “jokes,” will result in disciplinary action.  

- **Mutual Respect**: Treat others as you wish to be treated.  

- *Example*: Don’t dismiss someone’s opinion rudely just because you disagree.

## **2. No Advertising**  

This server is not a platform for promotion. Advertising of any kind is prohibited, including:  

- **Other Discord Servers**  

- *Example*: Posting invites to your new gaming Discord without permission.  

- **Social Media Accounts**  

- *Example*: Dropping your Twitch stream link without context.  

- **Services or Commissions**  

- *Example*: Offering to sell art or promoting your online shop.  

Advertising disrupts the community vibe and clutters conversations. Keep the focus on meaningful engagement.

## **3. Respect Boundaries and Read Profiles**  

Roles and profiles exist to set clear personal boundaries. Respect them at all times:  

- **Role Indicators are Important**: If someone has a role like “No Roleplay,” honor their preference.  

- *Example*: Don’t initiate a roleplay storyline with someone who has opted out, even as a “joke.”  

- **Consent is Key**: Ensure your actions are welcomed.  

- *Example*: Sending random friend requests or repeatedly tagging someone who hasn’t consented to it is disrespectful.  

- **Understand and Honor Preferences**: Take time to read roles and profiles to avoid misunderstandings.  

- *Example*: If someone has a “DMs Closed” role, don’t message them without permission.

## **4. No Mini-Modding**  

Moderation is for staff only. Here’s what we mean:  

- **No Nagging Staff**: Report issues once and trust the team to handle it.  

- *Example*: Constantly DMing staff to ask, “Did you handle my report yet?” is unnecessary.  

- **Use Proper Channels**: Submit tickets or reports using the designated systems.  

- *Example*: Instead of calling out someone in chat, use the **#complaints** channel.  

  We appreciate help, but leave the rule enforcement to moderators.

## **5. No Sexual Topics**  

While humor is welcome, explicit or inappropriate content is not.  

- **Server Age Rating**: Remember, this server is **+15**, not **+18**.  

- *Example*: Sharing explicit stories or discussing graphic sexual details is prohibited.  

- **Protecting Minors**: Avoid sexual topics around younger members.  

- *Example*: Making suggestive jokes when a minor is in the chat is not acceptable.  

Let’s maintain a space that’s comfortable for everyone.

## **6. Be Mindful in Voice Chats (VCs)**  

Voice chats are shared spaces. Follow these guidelines:  

- **Microphone Etiquette**: Keep your mic volume reasonable and avoid background noise.  

- *Example*: Don’t scream into the mic or play loud music during conversations.  

- **Be Considerate of Others**: Respect the flow of conversation and avoid dominating discussions.  

- *Example*: Constantly interrupting others or talking over them can make the VC unpleasant.  

- **Avoid Triggering Topics**: Refrain from discussing harmful or sensitive topics in public VCs.  

- *Example*: Don’t mention graphic or shocking subjects like violence or self-harm in a public channel.  

- **Examples of Misconduct**:  

- Screaming nonstop for no reason  

- Annoying members by intentionally disrupting the VC  

- Being rude or mean to others  

VCs should be welcoming and fun for all participants.
